## About Me

Hi! I'm a Shriya, a Statistics and Data Science Junior. I am student in Data Product Development and I joined this class because of my interests in PM and Data Analytics. Last summer, I was an intern at CBRE Investment Management as a Data Engineer. 

This site was built for a class assignment. I'm interested in data, design, and learning new tools.
